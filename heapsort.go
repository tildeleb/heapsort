// The heapsort package implements a simple heapsort algorithm.
//
// HeapSort proceeds in two phases. First we build a complete binary tree called the heap, while maintaining an invariant.
// Second, we take the highest value, now located at the root, index 0, and swap it with the last element.
// After the swap rebuild the heap with 1 less element, as the largest elements are repeatedly swapped to the end.
//
// The key data structure here, the heap, is really just a flattened complete binary tree.
// Complete means every level but the last is fully filled.
// Unlike many examples of Heapsort we use index 0, most start at index 1 
// The heap is accessed as follows.
// Given an element e at location i:
// the left child node of e is at 2 * i + 1,
// the right child node of e is at 2 * i + 2,
// the parent node of e is at (i-1) / 2, which implies the root is on the "left", at index 0
// the invariant that must be satisifed is that s[parent(i)] >= s[i].

// Knuth calles this function "siftup" and others call this "heapify". I hate both, but Knuth wins.
// Traverse a (sub)tree downwards starting at r, but stopping when we get to the end, ci < ni.
// While traversing check the invariant and if not satisfied fix it by swapping the root and child.
// NB: This function assumes that the nodes at the levels below the root already satisfy the invariant.
// EG: In order to build a healp from scratch all nodes at level l-1 must satisfy the invariant before level l.
func siftup(d Interface, ni, ri int) {
	for ri < (ni+1)/2 {
		ci := ri*2 + 1 // calculate left child node

		if ci < ni && d.Less(ci, ci+1) { // follow the largest node left or right
			ci++
		}
		if d.Less(ci, ri) { // invariant holds // ni < 1 || 
			break
		}
		// invariant doesn't hold, swap child and root and descent to the next level of tree
		d.Swap(ri, ci)
		ri = ci
